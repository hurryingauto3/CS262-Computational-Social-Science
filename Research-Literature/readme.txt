Head over to these youtube link if you want a quick introduction:

So there's like 5 papers I'm putting here best to read it in this order because some of them introduce the thing and then others are more complicated:
  1) Caging the Blob: Using a Slime Mold to Teach Concepts about Barriers that Constrain the Movement of Organisms
  2) Rules for Biologically Inspired Adaptive Network Design
  3) Slime mold uses an externalized spatial "memory" to navigate in complex environments
  4) Random network peristalsis in Physarum polycephalum organizes fluid flows across an individual

Optional but also an interesting read:
  5)Obtaining Multiple Separate Food Sources: Behavioural Intelligence in the Physarum Plasmodium

Update:
Added 2 more papers
"Mechanism of signal propagation in Physarum polycephalum"
"Maze-solving by an amoeboid organism"
