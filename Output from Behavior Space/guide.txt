The data in the csv is basically the data of 320 different runs with combinations of:
Prob_static in range 0 to 0.7 with increments of 0.1
Prob_random in range 0 to 0.7 with increments of 0.1
Prob_reproduction in range 0 to 0.4 with increments of 0.1
Initial number of agents are set to be 1000

note that all combinations of above mentioned settings are run
however each combination is run once due to computational limitations
(320 runs took almost an hour)
